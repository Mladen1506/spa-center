          <p>Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) technology delivers direct but gentle bursts of energy to the skin. IPL treatments are proven to significantly improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, pore size, textural irregularities, and vascular and pigmentation blemishes in over 80% of cases.</p>
          <p>Direct IPL energy passes through the epidermis and penetrates into the lower dermal layer, where it stimulates a cell called a fibroblast to produce new collagen. Over several treatments this new collagen softens and smoothes the appearance of wrinkes, outsized pores, and textural irregularities.</p>
          <p>Different wave lengths of IPL energy are used to improve rosacea, sun-damaged skin with pigmentation abnormalities, and vascular blemishes such as spider veins.</p>
          <p>Beneficial for:</p>
          <p><strong>Pigmented lesions</strong> such as hyperpigmentation, freckles, malesma, and sun/age spots.</p>
          <p><strong>Vascular lesions</strong> such as rosacea, spider veins, port wine stains, hemangiomas, angiomas, and venous malformations.</p>
