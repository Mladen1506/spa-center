          <h3>Permanent Eyeliner</h3>
          <p>Permanent eyeliner is achieved by inserting pigment into the skin of your eyelids along the upper and lower lash line, thus "permanently" drawing your eyeliner in the exact shape you want. This technique does not cut into the skin or cause scabbing - it is completely non-invasive. Numbing cream is used fora&nbsp; comfortable experience. The shape and thickness of the lines are discussed and decided on within your consultation.</p>
