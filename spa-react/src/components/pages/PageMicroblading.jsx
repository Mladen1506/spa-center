          <h6>Microblading</h6>
          <p>Natural hair-like strokes are drawn by a very fine, sterile, and 100% disposable hand held tool to enhance the shape and look of your brows. For the very best results, it is recommended to return for a touchup 3-4 weeks after treatment to perfect the color, shape, and density. It is recommended that you receive annual touch-ups to retain your ideal brow shape and pigmentation.</p>
          <p>$650</p>
          <p>*Includes one touch up only 3 weeks after treatment</p>
