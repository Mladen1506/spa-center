            <h3>Microblading</h3>
            <p>Microblading is designed for individuals who want to enhance the shape and look of their eyebrows and to achiever fuller eyebrows created with natural hair-like strokes. These natural hair-like strokes are drawn on by a very fine, sterile, and 100% disposable hand held tool that deposits pigment into the epidermis. Brow color may become significantly darker and sharper within the first few days of the procedure, but it will fade (approx. 30-50%) over the healing process. Since microblading is a multi-step process, it is recommended to return for an enhancement to perfect the color, shape, and density of the brows, for the very best results. After the initial session and the follow-up session, it is recommended that you receive annual touch-ups to retain your ideal brow shape and pigmentation.</p>

          <h3>Microblading and Ombre Shading Consultation</h3>
          <p>During our microblading or ombre shading consultation, we explain how microblading or ombre shading is done, what is involved, and prepare each client for what to expect during and after the procedure. We offer our clients a virtual eye brow design on their face during the consultation. This will allow the client to actually see what each brow shape will look like before the procedure is performed. We kindly ask that you come in for your consultation with no makeup so that we can evaluate your true skin undertone, which has a lot to do with how your eye brow color will behave and appear on the skin once healed. The consultation lasts for 30 minutes.</p>

          <p>*The consultation fee will be applied towards a microblading session, should you choose Microblading or Ombre Shading.</p>
