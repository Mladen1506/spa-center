          <h3>Organic Back Skincare Treatment</h3>
          <p>Think of it as a facial for your back. The ultimate in decadence, this treatment includes preparation of skin with steam or a warm towel, cleansing, exfoliation, massage, and masque. Designed to target and improve specific skin conditions – such as dryness, dehydration, and clogged pores – the “back facial” has the added benefit of reducing tension through massage.</p>
