          <h5>Lash Lift</h5>
          <p>The Lash Lift, also known as a Lash Perm, is targeted towards those with natural long lashes, and instantly gives your lashes lift, separation, and extra definition without the maintenance of eyelash extensions.<br /><br />
          <p>Touted as the gentle alternative to lash extensions, a lash lift essentially takes the natural eyelash hairs you do have and gives them a dramatic curl, giving you a fresh and natural look. By comparison, theyâ€™re pretty low-maintenance, and you can put mascara on an hour after the treatment if you really wanted to.</p> <br />
          The Lash Lift can last 6-8 weeks but can vary person to person.</p>
