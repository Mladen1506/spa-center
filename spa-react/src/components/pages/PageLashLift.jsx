          <h5>Lash Lift</h5>
          <p>The Lash Lift, also known as a Lash Perm, is targeted towards those with natural long lashes, and instantly gives your lashes lift, separation, and extra definition without the maintenance of eyelash extensions.</p>
          <p>Touted as the gentle alternative to lash extensions, a lash lift essentially takes the natural eyelash hairs you do have and gives them a dramatic curl, giving you a fresh and natural look that opens up the eye in the most beautiful way. By comparison, they’re pretty low-maintenance, and you can put mascara on an hour after the treatment if you really wanted to, provided you steer clear of any oil-based makeup removers.</p>
          <p>If eyelash extensions aren’t for you, consider giving a Lash Lift service a try! We know you will love the results. This service can give your lashes a lush look without the side effects some lash extension services can leave you with.</p>
          <p>The Lash Lift can last 6-8 weeks but can vary person to person.</p>
