          <h3>Take-Home Guidelines</h3>

          <p>HydraFacialTM is the only hydradermabrasion procedure that combines cleansing, extraction and hydration simultaneously, resulting in clearer, more beautiful skin with little-to-no downtime.</p>
          <p>The treatment is soothing, moisturizing, non-invasive and generally non-irritating. As with most procedures, visible results from HydraFacial will vary from person to person.</p>
          <h6><b>What to Expect During and Immediately After Treatment</b></h6>
          <p>Your skin may experience temporary irritation, tightness, or redness. These are all normal reactions that typically resolve within 72 hours depending on skin sensitivity.</p>
          <p>You may experience tingling and stinging during the treatment area. These sensations generally subside within three hours of treatment.</p>
          <p>Client experiences may vary. Some people may experience a delayed onset of the previously mentioned symptoms. Contact us immediately if any unusual side effects occur or if symptoms worsen over time.</p>
          <h6><b>Next Steps</b></h6>
          <p>You will likely see results immediately after treatment and your skin will feel smooth and hydrated for one to four weeks. For improved, longer lasting results, consider take-home products and monthly HydraFacial treatments.</p>
          <p>The treatment area is more susceptible to sunburn, sun damage and hyperpigmentation. Avoid direct sun exposure and use a minimum of SPF 40 sunscreen.</p>
          <p>Aggressive exfoliation, waxing and products containing acids should be avoided in the treatment area for a minimum of two weeks pre- and post-treatment. Avoid the use of Retin-A type products pre- and post-treatment.</p>
          <p>Avoid the use of Retin-A type products pre- and post-treatment.</p>
