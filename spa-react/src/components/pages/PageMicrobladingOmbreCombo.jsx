          <h3>Microblading and Ombre Shading Combination</h3>
          <p>A combination of Microblading and Ombre Shading combines the art of both of these semi-permanent makeup techniques together to achieve the most natural looking result. While Microblading resembles the brow hair, shading serves as a powdery background if certain hair does not take by the skin. Ombre shading has more of an effect with the tail to mid eyebrows being darker and slowly transition to lighter as it moves towards the front, creating a super natural look of filled-in brows without making them look tattooed.</p>
