          <h3>Advanced Premium Facials:Pamper Yourself</h3>
          <h6>Micro-dermabrasion with Facial</h6>
          <p>So effective, it’s like an instant facelift! During micro-dermabrasion, super-fine crystals slough off the dead cells of the outermost layer of the epidermis, where blemishes, sun damage, and other imperfections lie. With this outermost layer removed, the skin cells go into “repair mode,” replacing the lost skin cells with new ones, creating fresher and younger-looking skin. Combining micro-dermabrasion with a facial offers a significant added benefit: with the outer layer of skin cells gone, the ingredients of the facial can penetrate skin more easily, delivering nutrients and moisture exactly where they’re needed. Judge the results for yourself; you’ll be astonished at the beauty of your skin.</p>
          <h6>Lift &amp; Firm Facial</h6>
          <p>For those who desire a youthful appearance but eschew invasive treatments, this facial is perfect. The Lift &amp; Firm Facial features the organic Blueberry Detox Firming Peel from the renowned Éminence product line. Loaded with delectable goodness from nature -- blueberry, raspberry, blackberry, and pineapple -- the peel is ideally-suited for mature, thick, or sun-damaged skin. Designed to refine and clarify skin, to clear and minimize pores, and to remove dead skin allowing for easier penetration of nutrients and moisture, this facial also incorporates special massage techniques (delivered by the magical fingertips of your aesthetician) to counteract the effects of gravity and aging.</p>
          <h6>Prenatal Facial</h6>
          <p>A simple cleansing facial during pregnancy is completely safe. Additionally, it can help with the various skin changes that mothers-to-be may experience – things like dryness, puffiness, or breakouts. Skin can be sensitive during pregnancy, so we’ll use a gentle touch, along with the highest-quality products from our pregnancy-friendly Éminence line of organic skincare to address skin changes. Every mother-to-be deserves to look her best and to enjoy the sense of tranquility and pampering that our trained aestheticians can provide.</p>
          <h6>Manual Lymph Drainage Facial</h6>
          <p>The Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) Facial offers a specialized light massage technique that, when performed by a trained practitioner, assists the flow of lymph through lymph vessels. Combined with a facial, MLD is ideal for counteracting eye-area puffiness. MLD can also relieve congestion, blockage, and fluid buildup in connective tissue caused by chronic inflammation, hematoma, or surgical incisions. Incorporating MLD into pre- and post-cosmetic surgery routines can promote a faster recovery by transporting damaged cells, inflammatory agents, and toxins away from the area of surgery. Among its other beneficial effects, MLD can reduce signs of sun damage and can relieve the tight, itchy feeling that often accompanies eczema and dermatitis, promoting healthy skin.</p>
          <h6>Organic Back Facial with Massage</h6>
          <p>So nourishing and pampering, we call it a "facial" for your back. Using the finest Éminence products, we first relax you by applying steam or a warm towel. The treatment continues with cleansing and exfoliation. Then enjoy a relaxing massage, and finish with a masque. This luxurious treatment allows your beautiful bare shoulders to be their prettiest. While the back “facial” is great for summertime, when shoulders and backs are subjected to perspiration and sun (and need some TLC), don’t forget the holiday season, when the little black dress bares pretty shoulders for holiday parties and New Year’s Eve.</p>
