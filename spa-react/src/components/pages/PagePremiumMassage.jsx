          <h3>Premium Massage Experience</h3>
          <p>Requiring additional expertise and certification, the Premium Massage treatments offer an extended combination of ancient healing arts, pain reduction, and relaxation.</p>
          <h6>Aromatherapy</h6>
          <p>A healing and relaxing technique, this treatment uses fragrant oils extracted from herbs, flowers, and fruits to naturally enhance the benefits of massage. The sensory experience of surrounding yourself in the beauty of botanical essential oils can be both soothing and invigorating.</p>
          <h6>Bamboo</h6>
          <p>In many Asian cultures, bamboo symbolizes life energy, longevity, strength, and prosperity. In our bamboo massage, you will experience the ancient art of massage to relieve pain, relax from stress, and encourage healing. We incorporate heated bamboo stalks of varying sizes during the massage to help the muscles relax and to provide a deep sense of relaxation and well-being.</p>
          <h6>Chakra Balancing</h6>
          <p>Chakra balancing is a deeply meditative form of energy healing that brings the body's seven main chakras into alignment through a fluid combination of massage, specific essential oil blends, and healing crystals. This unique experience leaves guests feeling calm and in a state of harmony, resulting in an increased feeling of well being.</p>
          <div></div>
          <h6>Cranial Sacral therapy</h6>
          <p>Biodynamic cranial sacral therapy is a light-touch modality that supports the health of the entire body, especially the nervous system, enabling the body’s deep relaxation and reduction of symptoms.</p>
          <h6>Cupping</h6>
          <p>Plastic cups are positioned at the area to be treated (i.e muscles, scar tissue, cellulite, abdomen for digestive system), and a vacuum is created within the cup to draw the skin and underlying tissue into the cup. People get it for many purposes, including to help with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep tissue massage.</p>
          <h6>Deep Tissue</h6>
          <p>More vigorous and penetrating than some techniques, this type of Swedish massage is best for anyone who enjoys a more intense and robust massage experience. Slower strokes with increased pressure target tension at the deeper layers of muscle tissue, promoting relief for stressed and overworked muscles.</p>
          <h6>Hot Stone Therapy</h6>
          <p>Deeply relaxing, this is a therapy that uses smooth heated stones to relieve pain, promote inner harmony, and balance energy. Feel your stress dissipate as soothing heat penetrates areas of aches or pains.</p>
          <h6>Myofascial Release</h6>
          <p>Myofascial release is used to apply gentle sustained directional pressure to the fascial tissue that wraps all parts of the body beneath the skin (like a sweater) and that has become less pliable because of the variety of ways the body engages with life.</p>
          <h6>Prenatal</h6>
          <p>Designed to promote well-being and relaxation for the mother-to-be, this massage is safe and healthy for pregnant women. It is designed to provide relief from spasms in the lower back, as well as reduce swelling in the legs.</p>
          <h6>Sport</h6>
          <p>This treatment prepares the body for athletic activity and maintains optimal conditioning. It also helps athletes to recover from strenuous workouts and promotes healing for certain types of injuries.</p>
          <h6>Stress Relief</h6>
          <p>Let the skilled hands of our massage therapists soothe your stress with calming peppermint oil, as they reduce tension with pressure point manipulation and healing massage. Feel your tight muscles relax and your stress dissolve as we envelop you in aromatic oils and the warmth of a special heated pad.</p>
          <h6>Thai</h6>
          <p>Based on Eastern traditions, Thai massage is an ancient form of body work developed by Buddhist monks some 2500 years ago -- although it is relatively new to Western spa-goers. Thai massage uses passive stretching and gentle pressure along the body’s energy lines to increase flexibility, relieve muscle and joint tension, and balance the body’s energy systems. Thai massage is both deeply relaxing and energizing, and it will leave you feeling relaxed and limber. (Please note that Thai is offered for 75- and 90-minute durations only.)</p>
          <h6>Travel Relief</h6>
          <p>For the traveler (or anyone) who needs to release tension from sitting too long in a confined space, this massage is a combination of hot packs, stretching, and deep-tissue work on legs, back, shoulders, and neck. It is designed specifically for those who need to increase circulation and relieve aches caused by air travel and long car trips.</p>
