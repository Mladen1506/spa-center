          <h6>Premium Massage Experience</h6>
          <p>Our Premium Massage treatments offer an extended combination of ancient healing arts, pain reduction, and relaxation.</p>

          <h6>Aromatherapy</h6>
          <p>Fragrant essential oils are used in this treatment, which are extracted from herbs, flowers, and fruits to naturally enhance the benefits of massage. This sensory experience is both soothing and invigorating.</p>

          <h6>Bamboo</h6>
          <p>Bamboo symbolizes life energy, longevity, strength, and prosperity. In our bamboo massage, we incorporate heated bamboo stalks of varying sizes to help the muscles relax from stress, relieve pain, and provide a deep sense of relaxation and well-being.</p>

          <h6>Chakra Balancing</h6>
          <p>Chakra balancing is a form of energy healing that brings the body's seven main chakras into alignment through a fluid combination of massage, specific essential oil blends, and healing crystals. This unique experience leaves guests feeling calm and in a state of harmony, resulting in an increased feeling of well being.</p>

          <h6>Cupping</h6>
          <p>Therapeutic cups are positioned at specific areas to create a vacuum within the cup to draw the skin and underlying tissue inside. This increases blood flow to the area and helps reduce pain and inflammation. Deep tissue massage is incorporated with this treatment.</p>

          <h6>Deep Tissue</h6>
          <p>Best for anyone who enjoys a more intense and robust massage experience, slower strokes with increased pressure target tension at the deeper layers of muscle tissue, promoting relief for stressed and overworked muscles.</p>

          <h6>Hot Stone Therapy</h6>
          <p>Deeply relaxing, this is a therapy that uses smooth heated basalt stones to relieve pain, promote inner harmony, and balance energy. Feel your stress dissipate as soothing heat penetrates areas of aches or pains.</p>

          <h6>Prenatal</h6>
          <p>Designed to promote well-being and relaxation for the mother-to-be, this massage is safe and healthy for pregnant women. It is designed to provide relief from lower back pain and increase circulation throughout the body, as well as reduce swelling in the legs.</p>

          <h6>Sport</h6>
          <p>This treatment can prepare the body for athletic activity or help athletes to recover from strenuous workouts. Stretching and deep tissue are incorporated and can also promote healing for certain types of injuries.</p>

          <h6>Stress Relief</h6>
          <p>Soothe your senses with stress relieving peppermint oil, as muscle tension is reduced with pressure point manipulation and healing massage. Feel your tight muscles relax and your stress dissolve as we envelop you in aromatic oils and the warmth of a special heated pad.</p>

          <h6>Thai</h6>
          <p>Thai massage uses passive stretching and stimulates pressure points along the body’s energy lines to increase flexibility, relieve muscle and joint tension, and balance the body’s energy systems. It is both deeply relaxing and energizing, and will leave you feeling relaxed and limber. (Please note that Thai is offered for 75- and 90-minute durations only.)</p>

          <h6>Travel Relief</h6>
          <p>For those who need to relieve aches and pains caused by tension from air travel or long car trips, this massage relieves tension by using a combination of hot packs, stretching, and deep-tissue work on legs, back, shoulders, and neck.</p>
