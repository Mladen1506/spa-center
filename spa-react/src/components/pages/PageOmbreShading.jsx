          <h5>Ombre Shading (Eyebrows)</h5>
          <p>Ombre Shading is a semi-permanent treatment which gives the brows a soft, shaded, misty-like powder look. We insert color pigmentation into the upper layers of the skin to create the tails of the brow darker and fade into a lighter pigmentation as we get closer to the start of the brow, for the perfect ombre effect on your eyebrows. Once pigmentation fades, it will return back to your natural brows and skin. This method is waterproof and smudge-proof, and usually lasts longer than microblading (from 1 to 3 years; around 2 years on average) depending on skin type and lifestyle factors. Once healed, it is more natural looking than solid color. It gives great definition and depth to the brows.</p>
