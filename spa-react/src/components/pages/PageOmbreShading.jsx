          <h5>Ombre Shading (Eyebrows)</h5>
          <p>A soft, shaded, misty-like powder look is created by making the tail of the brows darker that fade into a lighter shade at the start of the brow.  It usually lasts longer than microblading and is the perfect technique to add great definition and depth to the brows.</p>
