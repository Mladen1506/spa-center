          <h6>Treatment</h6>
          <p>Broken facial capillaries can be treated with a simple method that targets only the damaged area, using a fine probe to cauterize the veins. Because the targeting is so specific, the time and cost to treat can be kept minimal. The procedure is painless and not at all invasive.</p>
