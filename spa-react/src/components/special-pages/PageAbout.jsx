            <h3>Azure Dream Spa Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Azure Dream Day Spa owner and founder, Leila Espari, has been involved in skin care and esthetics in the NOVA area for many years. When Leila opened the doors to Azure Dream Spa in 2010, she knew she was creating a welcoming space where she could offer her longtime (and new) clients a superlative spa experience.</p>
            <p>To create that superlative experience, Leila believes in offering her clients the best when it comes to <a href="https://azuredreamspa.com/about-us/our-staff/">staff</a>, equipment, and <a href="https://azuredreamspa.com/packages-products/">products</a>. Leila carefully hand-picks her technicians, ensuring not only the highest professional standards, expertise, and certification, but also warm and caring personalities. When it comes to equipment, Leila also sets the bar high: only the latest equipment and regular upgrades, which is why Azure’s technicians can now offer such industry breakthroughs as laser hair removal for all skin tones, using state-of-the-art <a href="https://azuredreamspa.com/packages-products/candela-2/">Candela </a>technology. Along with equipment, Leila believes in the value of top-of-the-line products, which is why Azure’s delectable facials and treatments have all the goodness of organic ingredients, vitamins, and nutrients, through the world-renown <a href="https://azuredreamspa.com/packages-products/eminence/">Éminence</a> Skin Care line imported from Hungary.</p>
            <p>Paying attention to the smallest detail – right down to the spa’s Eastern-inspired décor and soothing earth tones – Leila brings her philosophy to life for clients every day. Whether you come for hair removal, facials, massages, or Azure’s many other offerings, you’ll find a soothing retreat, with discreet, friendly, personal service – and results that will keep you returning. So, step through the door and be greeted by warm decor, friendly smiles, and a cup of coffee or tea. Leila’s personal warmth and exacting standards combine to offer the ultimate spa experience in a luxurious and welcoming environment.</p>
            <p>Leila and her staff are proud to invite you to experience the warmth and relaxation of Azure Dream Day Spa.</p>
